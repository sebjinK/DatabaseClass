Scenario 2 - University Parking Tickets
A. For this database, it would help to have the student's email set as the primary key for a singular data base. Since each student's email is unique and non-repeating, it's a great way to keep track of the students within the database. In this case, since we are only tracking a few number of items within the database, such as the email, first name, last name, and number of parking tickets, we can keep it all to one table with four columns.
B.
CREATE TABLE tblStudentParkingTickets
(
	StudentEmail VARCHAR(50),
	FirstName VARCHAR(25),
	LastName VARCHAR(35),
	NumberOfParkingTickets INT,

D.
UPDATE tblStudentTickets SET NumberOfTickets = 2 WHERE StudentEmail = 'sjkennedy43@tntech.edu';
E.
UPDATE tblStudentTickets SET NumberOfTickets = 0;
